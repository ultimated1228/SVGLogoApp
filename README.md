## Description
Ever wanted to create a simple logo?  This logo designer allows you to pick the background color, shape, stroke width, stroke color, and lay over  1 to 3 letters in the color of your choice.  This was completed as part of the UC-Irvine Bootcamp assignments.

## Installation
Download the repo. Open the main folder within a command-line terminal. Run "npm i" to install the needed dependencies. If for some reason the package.json file is unavailble to automatically run these dependencies, install them manually. You will need inquirer, node-fetch, and jester. Once npm is installed simply run "node index" in a command-line terminal.  To run the tests use "npm test".
